This weekend (26.03.2011) we will hold a 12 hour Hackaton, starting Saturday at 6PM till Sunday morning (6AM).

We started this event with the idea that WoUSO developers should get toghether and do some real hacking. Now, we will hold a general hacking event, where everyone is invited.

If you want to participate just register yourself here [0]. You can hack whatever you want. We also decided that every participant should put in a small amunt of money for pizza and drinks (20 RON). The event will take place in EG306 room in Politehnica Campus.

If you need directions just ask on rosedu mailing list or on IRC: #rosedu on freenode. Hope to see you there!
