Do you like writing code? Do you like working together with other programmers? Are words like commit, debugging, IDE, malloc, threads part of your vocabulary?

If so, we invite you to participate on the 16th-17th of April 2011 weekend to one of the coolest hacking events[1].

If you want to develop one of your own ideas or to work on an older project that you didnâ€™t have time to work on or just want to work in a team, then this event is for you!

You will get to meet business people, as well as other people that are passionate about hacking with whom you can discuss your ideas.

Please confirm your participation here[1] and come Saturday, 16th of April, at the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, room EG106 (for hacking we will use EG207, EG306 and EG405).

This event is organized by the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, ROSEdu and Cronian Labs.

Be there!
