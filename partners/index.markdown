    [Europe](http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/students/tech/internships/emea/),
    [US](http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/students/tech/internships/uscanada/)

Engineering internship opportunities are full-time positions and take
place year-round. We accept students from multiple disciplines – including CS,
EE, Maths, Physics – so students studying a variety of subjects are encouraged
to apply. Google internships start and end dates are flexible with regard to
academic schedules, but you’ll be expected to commit to at least three months of
full-time work.

We want to make sure we provide you a valuable learning experience and a deeper
understanding of Google’s work environment, culture, and delicious food.

We review applications on an ongoing basis; as projects are allocated to
successful candidates soon after we interview them, to maximize your chances of
success we encourage you to apply as early as possible in the academic year.
