### Why?

In order to continually develop our projects, ROSEdu needs an annual buget
to cover the costs of each program. By making a donation, you can help us
in our mission of bringing open-source to Romanian students.

### Sponsors

We are always searching for sponsors and partnerships for our programs.
You can support ROSEdu&#39;s programs and, in exchange, we\'ll help you
gain good visibility among the students and graduates that participate in
 our programs or attend our presentations. To find out more, do not hesitate
